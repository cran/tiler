\description{
Options for tiler package.
}
\details{
On Windows systems, if the system paths for \code{python.exe} and \code{OSGeo4W.dat} are not added to the system path, they must be provided by the user after loading the package.
It is recommended to add these to the system path so they do not need to be specified for every R session. They may be installed to different locations on different Windows systems.

Currently, \code{tiler} will make a single attempt during package load to look for \code{OSGeo4W.bat} in one location: \code{C:/Program Files/QGIS 3.0/OSGeo4W.bat}. If it is not found at this exact location and it is not on the system path,
it will be unavailable to \code{tile} unless the user specifies the path in \code{tiler_options}.

Finding the installation is not the responsibility of \code{tiler}. Best practice is to know these paths on Windows and proactively add them to the system path so that they are automatically available to programs like R.
As long as \code{OSGeo4W.bat} is unavailable, \code{tile} will proceed as it would on other systems such as Linux, by assuming GDAL is installed and accessible to Python on the system, regardless of OSGeo installations.

The recommended way to have GDAL available to Python in Windows is to install \href{https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/}{OSGeo4W}. This is commonly installed along with \href{https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html}{QGIS}.
This being the common method for having these system requirements available on Windows is the reason the \code{tiler} package bothers to attempt using \code{OSGeo4W.bat} first.

None of this applies to other systems. As long as the system requirements, Python and GDAL, are installed, then \code{tile} should generate tiles without getting or setting any \code{tiler_options}.
